## Project Description
Memory Games Teaching Important Facts is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The project aims to combine fun and education by creating an interactive memory game where players can test their knowledge on various important facts. The game will allow players to match facts and answers, and earn rewards based on their performance. The facts are stored on the blockchain for transparency, and players' scores are tracked on-chain.

## Contract Address
0x91D0b6707a6079E50D66ED60D45D4C2Ccd506Fd1

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a fun and interactive way for people to learn important facts while engaging in a memory-based game. By integrating with blockchain technology, it ensures that all facts are transparent, secure, and immutable. Players will have a gamified experience of learning with the opportunity to track their performance and earn rewards.


## Key Features
- **Fact Management**: Only the owner can add and deactivate facts.
- **Player Interaction**: Players can reveal facts and match them to their corresponding answers.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for each correct fact matched, and their scores are stored on-chain.
- **Transparency**: All facts are stored on the blockchain, ensuring security and transparency.
- **Event Emission**: Events are emitted when facts are added, games are completed, or facts are revealed, allowing for easier tracking of interactions.

## Future Improvements
The following improvements could enhance the game's functionality and user experience:

1. **Multiplayer Support**: Allow multiple players to compete or collaborate in the game. Implementing a multiplayer mode would make the game more engaging.
   
2. **Reward System**: Introduce a token or cryptocurrency reward system, where players can earn tokens based on their performance and redeem them for prizes or use them for further interactions within the game.

3. **Interactive Frontend**: Develop a user-friendly frontend where players can easily interact with the contract through their browser using Web3.js or ethers.js. This could include an interactive UI for displaying questions, answers, and game progress.

4. **Timed Challenges**: Introduce timed challenges where players must answer facts within a certain period, making the game more competitive and fast-paced.

5. **Fact Categories**: Allow the contract to categorize facts (e.g., science, history, geography) so that players can select specific categories for the game.

6. **Leaderboard**: Create a leaderboard that displays the top players based on their scores. This could motivate players to improve their knowledge and compete against others.

7. **Fact Editing**: Allow the owner or authorized users to edit existing facts (questions or answers) to correct errors or update outdated information.

8. **Customizable Fact Sets**: Let users create custom sets of facts and challenge their friends or other players to complete them.
